# Slime Train v1 — Build plan

Status: draft v2 (proposed; waiting for the user's review)

This plan splits `master-spec.md` into build chunks, ordered so that each one
can be **tested as soon as it lands**. The master spec stays the reference for
behaviour. This document only settles the order, the size of each chunk, and
what "tested" means for it. Numbers in brackets such as [DoD 6] are the master
spec's Definition of done criteria (§9). Fixture names come from
`../../levels/test/README.md`.

## Principles

1. **Test backbone first.** Seeded randomness, time control and scripted input
   come before any gameplay, so every later chunk ships with automated
   tests on the Linux build.
2. **Risky things are checked before they are built for real.** The master
   spec's known technical risks (soft slimes at 200, vector look, headless
   tests, tilt) are checked with throwaway spikes first.
3. **Grow the test level with the features.** Section 1 (Meadow) is
   greyboxed early. Sections 2 and 3 are added when the features they
   exercise exist.
4. **The save format comes early**, because test fixtures are saves. It grows
   with each feature instead of arriving at the end.
5. **Desktop before Android.** Everything that can be tested on the Linux
   build is. Android-only work (pinning, device credential, sensors, lifecycle)
   is grouped into its own chunks.
6. **Placeholder interface.** The parent screens get working placeholder UI.
   Their real design comes from the UX track (`ui_ux/`), which has not
   started.
7. Each chunk ends with its tests green and a short demo on the test level
   (or a test scene before the test level exists).

Sizes are relative: **S** is small, **M** is a few days of focused work,
**L** is large and a candidate to split further when it starts.

## Overview

| # | Chunk | Size | Depends on | Tested by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Tooling and project setup | S | — | a headless test runs from the command line |
| 1 | Spike: soft slimes at scale | M | 0 | fps measured with 200 slimes (desktop, then phones) |
| 2 | Spike: vector look | S | 0 | a screenshot comparison, and a decision recorded |
| 3 | Test backbone | M | 0 | two identical scripted runs give identical state |
| 4 | Level scaffolding and Meadow greybox | M | 3 | the loop, terrain and IDs load in a test |
| 5 | Slime body | L | 1, 4 | unit tests on rings; a visual demo |
| 6 | Train and split zone | M | 5 | [DoD 1 partial, 7] |
| 7 | Taps and the call | L | 6 | [DoD 3, 4, 15, 17] |

| 14 | Frontier set, gates and completion | L | 8, 12 | [DoD 9, 11, 12, 13, 14]; `s1-basket-5of6`, `s1-optout` |
| 15 | Off-screen simulation | L | 14 | [DoD 5, 10]; `s2-cave-return`, `lost`, `s2-basket-offscreen` |
| 16 | Test level sections 2 and 3, full population | M | 15 | [DoD 1] in full; `gate1-open`, `stress-*` |
| 17 | Session, wind-down, bedtime, sunrise | M | 8 | [DoD 20, 21, 22]; `wind-down`, `bedtime`, `sunrise` |
| 18 | Parent gate and settings (placeholder UI) | M | 17 | [DoD 23, 24, 29] |
| 19 | Persistence hardening | M | 16, 18 | [DoD 28]; `midair`, `old-version` |
| 20 | Android build and platform integration | L | 18 | [DoD 25, 26, 27]; emulator |
| 21 | End-to-end suite | M | 19 | [DoD 31] |
| 22 | Performance pass on phones | M | 20 | [DoD 30] |

Chunks 1 and 2 can run in parallel with 3. Chunks 9, 10 and 11 are
independent of each other. Chunk 17 can start as soon as 8 is done, in
parallel with the camera and objects work.

## Chunks

### 0. Tooling and project setup (S)

- The Godot binary reachable from a stable path (the user's choice, see
  "Before starting").
- Project settings match the spec: landscape locked, 2D. The 3D physics
  engine setting that project creation added is irrelevant.
  The renderer choice (the "Compatibility" renderer is the current default)
  is confirmed by spike 1.
- A folder layout for components, levels, the simulation core, and tests.
- A test framework picked by the implementer, runnable headless from the
  command line.
- **Done when:** `godot --headless` runs one trivial test and returns a
  non-zero exit code when it fails.

### 1. Spike: soft slimes at scale (M, throwaway)

- A ring-of-springs slime and the blending shader, with 200 slimes on one
  screen: still (piled) and moving.
- Measure on the desktop first, then on the reference phone, and on a floor
  phone once one is bought.
- **Done when:** the numbers are written down, with a go/no-go for the
  approach and the renderer. A no-go comes back to spec-writer before
  chunk 5 starts.

### 2. Spike: vector look (S, throwaway)

- Godot turns SVGs into images at import. Compare polygons and lines drawn in
  code against a vector plugin for crisp curves when zoomed.
- **Done when:** the approach is chosen and recorded as an architecture
  decision.

### 3. Test backbone (M)

- One seeded random generator for all gameplay randomness.
- A fixed simulation step, so runs don't depend on frame rate.
- **Test mode** (Linux and debug Android builds only): speed up or skip
  time, inject taps and tilt from a script, and load a named fixture (a stub
  until chunk 8).
- A way to dump the simulation state (or a hash of it) for comparisons.
- The headless end-to-end runner. This also settles the risk of running
  end-to-end tests on Linux without a screen.
- **Done when:** the same script and seed run twice give the same state
  hash, and test mode is absent from a release export.

### 4. Level scaffolding and Meadow greybox (M)

- A level scene built from components, with no per-level scripts: the loop as
  a drawn route, terrain from paths and collision polygons, routes back as
  level data, stable IDs, and the level version.
- The shared rule format that components use ("when this basket is full,
  open that gate"), at least as an interface.
- Section 1 (Meadow) of the test level as a greybox with placeholder art.
- **Done when:** a test loads the level and finds the loop, the route back and
  every stable ID of section 1.

### 5. Slime body (L)

- Production version of spike 1: a soft body with sizes 1 to 3, six species
  colours (differing in lightness too), hopping as the only movement, and
  hop cadence from the seeded generator.
- Fusion and splitting as ring operations, exposed for later chunks.
- **Done when:** unit tests cover ring creation, merging and splitting, and a
  demo scene shows slimes of each size and species hopping.

### 6. Train and split zone (M)

- Train slimes follow the loop by hopping (about 1.5–3 s, random per slime).
  Physics handles only the squish and the bumps.
- The split zone at the start of the loop. The return route is part of the
  loop in section 1 (the placeholder slide).
- The game wakes the first slime.
- **Done when:** with no input on the Meadow, the train loops for a full
  simulated session and no slime is lost [DoD 1, section 1 only], and
  every slime entering the split zone leaves as base slimes [DoD 7].

### 7. Taps and the call (L)

- Tap dispatch in the spec's order: top of the screen, edge buttons, object,
  open ground. At this stage only open ground does anything.
- The ripple on every tap. The first touch wins.
- The call: the radius, train slimes answering, the three phases of a free
  slime (answering, unsure, heading back by the route back), and rejoining
  the train.
- **Done when:** scripted taps satisfy [DoD 3, 4, 15, 17].

### 8. Save format and fixtures (M)

- One save per level: each slime's species, size, state and position, and
  the object states (empty for now), with the level version and stable IDs.
- Autosave every 15 s and when the app goes to the background.
- Fixture loading in test mode. The fixtures are save files.
- **Done when:** a kill-and-reload test restores the slimes, and test mode
  loads a hand-made fixture.

### 9. Sleepers, waking and the first-play hint (S)

- A sleeper wakes only when a free slime touches it on screen. Tapping a
  sleeper is a call centred on it.
- The first-play hint: a wordless pulse near the first sleeper after about
  10 s with no call, shown on the first play only.
- **Done when:** [DoD 2, 16] pass, starting from `fresh`.

### 10. Fusion and bumping (M)

- Same-species contact for 3 s fuses. A hop that breaks contact resets the
  count. A fusion above size 3 bumps instead. The dip in the loop nudges
  fusion.
- **Done when:** [DoD 6] passes, including `bump` (2 + 2 and 3 + 1).

### 11. Tilt, desktop and injected (S)

- Gravity turns with tilt up to ±45°, with a dead zone of about 10°. Neutral
  is taken at session start, and lying flat counts as neutral. Only free
  slimes feel it.
- The input is injected on desktop here. The real sensor comes in chunk 20.
- **Done when:** [DoD 8] passes with scripted tilt.

### 12. Camera: rails, edge buttons, call drag (M)

- The camera on rails along the loop, return routes included. Right always
  means forward along the loop.
- The edge buttons (hidden at bedtime, once chunk 17 exists).
- The call pulls the camera slowly toward the call point.
- **Done when:** the edge buttons move the camera along the loop in both
  directions, round the frontier turn, and the child has no zoom control.

### 13. Camera: framing zones, idle camera, screensaver zoom (M)

- Framing zones as a level component, including the longer push to leave
  one.
- The idle camera after 45 s, with the zoom-out cue 10 s before, following a
  train slime through fusion and splitting.
- One shared zoom for idle and screensaver mode. Framing zones are ignored
  while either follows a slime, and resume on touch if the camera's centre
  is still in a zone.
- **Done when:** [DoD 18, 19] pass on the Meadow's framing zones. The minimum
  zoom is still an open point: log what the Meadow's zones show.

### 14. Frontier set, gates and completion (L)

- The switch (stays flipped), the basket (outlines by weight, the reward
  waiting for view, firing, release), the gate (extends the loop and replaces
  the return route), inert for good afterwards, signposts, and the one-time
  celebration.
- Opting out: flipping the switch back releases the slimes and empties the
  basket.
- Object state in the save.
- **Open point:** where a basket releases its slimes is part of the basket's
  own design, which isn't planned yet. Build the test level's assumption (one
  outlet onto the onward route) behind a property, so it can change.
- **Done when:** [DoD 9, 11, 12, 13, 14] pass, with `s1-basket-5of6` and
  `s1-optout`, while the basket is on screen.

### 15. Off-screen simulation (L)

- Physics only on or near the screen. Off-screen train slimes move as
  positions along the loop at a deterministic pace, and spawn just outside the
  view when it comes near.
- Free slimes that leave the screen follow their area's route back. Left
  alone at 10 s, lost at 1 min, and moved to the start.
- Baskets count weight off screen. Fusion and waking happen on screen only.
- Cheaper states: sleepers don't simulate, slimes in a full basket are
  simplified, and zoomed-out slimes use fewer points.
- **Done when:** [DoD 5, 10] pass, with `s2-cave-return`, `lost` and
  `s2-basket-offscreen`. Needs section 2 in greybox, pulled forward from
  chunk 16.

### 16. Test level sections 2 and 3, full population (M)

- Caves and the Big bowl in greybox, all frontier sets, all framing zones, and
  the full population of 200 slimes.
- The level rules checklist run against the test level.
- **Done when:** [DoD 1] holds for the whole level, and `gate1-open`,
  `stress-still` and `stress-moving` load. The stress fixtures give desktop
  performance numbers.

### 17. Session, wind-down, bedtime, sunrise (M)

- Screensaver mode, the first tap starting a 15-minute real-time session,
  the dusk wind-down in the last minute, bedtime (the slimes sleep, the game
  saves, taps are inert but still ripple, the edge buttons hide), and sunrise
  after 10 minutes.
- Timers stored with both the wall clock and the monotonic clock.
- **Done when:** [DoD 20, 21, 22] pass on desktop with time skipping (the
  "wake early" path waits for chunk 18), with `wind-down`, `bedtime` and
  `sunrise`.

### 18. Parent gate and settings, placeholder UI (M)

- First-launch setup (the code typed twice, the explanations), the top-of-
  screen reveal, wake early (bedtime only), leave, and settings (change the
  code; delete a level's save with a second confirmation).
- A wrong code shakes and clears. After 5 wrong tries in a row there is a
  30 s wait. The prompt closes after about 15 s with no input, and settings
  closes by itself. Nothing pauses.
- The code is stored locally, never in plain text.
- The rules follow `access-model.md`.
- **Done when:** [DoD 23, 24, 29] pass on desktop. The "forgot the code?"
  path is stubbed until chunk 20.

### 19. Persistence hardening (M)

- Atomic writes with one backup, used when the latest save can't be read.
- A slime in mid-air on load: grounded, or put back at the start of its jump,
  or lost.
- Save migration by level version: displaced slimes count as lost.
- **Done when:** [DoD 28] passes, including a kill during a write, with
  `midair` and `old-version`.

### 20. Android build and platform integration (L)

- Android export, landscape lock, the screen kept on during a session, and
  background and kill lifecycle feeding saves and timers.
- Screen pinning requested at each launch, and "leave" ending it. This needs
  an Android plugin; check how Godot 4.7 plugins call `startLockTask()` early
  in the chunk.
- "Forgot the code?" through Android's system prompt with the device
  credential.
- Real tilt from the sensor.
- No network permission in the manifest.
- **Done when:** [DoD 25, 26, 27] pass on the emulator, and tilt feels right on
  the reference phone.

### 21. End-to-end suite (M)

- Every fixture in the test level's list has at least one scripted
  end-to-end test, and the suite runs headless on the Linux build.
- **Done when:** [DoD 31] passes, and the suite is repeatable (same seed, same
  result).

### 22. Performance pass on phones (M)

- `stress-still` and `stress-moving`, plus normal play, on the reference
  phone and the floor phone.
- **Done when:** [DoD 30] holds. If the floor phone can't hold 200 slimes, the
  floor rises. The 200 cap stays.

## Not in this plan

- **The real first level:** its design session comes after chunk 16, once the
  test level has been played. v1 ships that level, not the test level.
- **The interface design** of the parent screens, setup and the celebration:
  the UX track. The placeholder UI from chunk 18 is replaced then.
- **Playtesting with children** [DoD 32]: after chunks 20 and 22, on the
  real first level.
- **The basket's own design** (where it releases its slimes): a later
  spec session. Chunk 14 keeps it swappable.

## Open questions that block chunks

Raised by the first UX review. Each must be settled before its chunk is
finished (see the master spec's Known gaps, item 6):

| Chunk | Questions |
|---|---|
| 7 Taps and the call | O67 (second-finger ripple) |
| 9 Hint | O71 (when the 10 s start; reset on delete) |
| 12 Camera rails | O70 (edge-button press) |
| 17 Session | O68 (reopening the app), O69 (which taps start a session) |
| 18 Parent gate | O72 (deleting the running save), O73 (forgotten code), O76 (wrong-code wait), O77 (language) |
| 20 Android | O74 (pinning timing), O75 (back gesture without pinning) |

## Before starting

- Put the Godot 4.7.2 binary on a stable path, for example a `godot` symlink
  in `~/.local/bin`, so agents and scripts call `godot` and not a versioned
  path in `~/work/`.
- A floor phone (Galaxy A14 class) has to be bought before spike 1 can finish
  and before chunk 22.
