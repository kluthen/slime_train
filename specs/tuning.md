# Tuning values

Status: live

Every number the spec leaves to prototypes and playtests, with the starting
value to try. When a value is tuned, update it here and log the result in
`decisions.md`.

| Value | Start at | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Fusion contact time | 3 s (a hop resets it) | D37 |
| Unsure phase after a call | up to about 15 s | D27 |
| Left alone (off screen) | 10 s | D10 |
| Lost (left alone, not back) | 1 min | D10 |
| Idle camera takes over | 45 s with no input | D32 |
| Idle camera cue | starts 10 s before | D32, D62 |
| Screensaver and idle zoom | 10–20% wider than normal play | D60, D62 |
| Delay before leaving a framing zone | a bit longer than a normal move | D61 |
| Camera drag toward a call: speed, and when it goes back | slow and steady; to try | D45 |
| Call radius | about half the screen width (proposed) | O21 |
| How often a slime hops, and how far | every few seconds; grows with size | D21, O40 |
| Tilt | ±45° cap, about 10° dead zone | D19 |
| Session length | 15 min (fixed in v1) | D29 |
| Cooldown after bedtime | 10 min | D29, D44 |
| Bedtime wind-down | the last minute | D28 |
| Autosave interval | 15 s | D12 |
| First-play hint appears after | about 10 s without a call | D65 |
| Calls at the same time | 1: the first touch wins; try 2 later | D66 |
